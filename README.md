# 🧠 GenAI Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation

Welcome to my project submission for the **GenAI-Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation**, designed to replicate real-world problem-solving in a fintech setting.

This simulation focused on using **Generative AI tools** to analyze customer credit data, identify risk patterns, and develop a predictive model for **delinquency risk**, while maintaining ethical and responsible AI practices.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Company Simulated**: Geldium (a fictional financial services company)  
**Goal**: Help the Collections Team reduce delinquency by predicting at-risk customers and designing a responsible, AI-powered collections system.

## 🧩 Tasks & Deliverables

### ✅ Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned and analyzed credit and demographic data
- Identified key risk indicators (e.g., credit utilization > 70%, missed payments)
- Found surprising patterns (e.g., no clear link between age and delinquency)

---

### ✅ Task 2: Predictive Model Planning
- Chose two model options: Logistic Regression (simple), XGBoost (complex)
- Selected **XGBoost** for its performance and flexibility
- Identified top 5 predictive features:
  - Credit Utilization
  - Payment History
  - Income-to-Debt Ratio
  - Number of Credit Inquiries
  - Length of Credit History

---

### ✅ Task 3: Business Recommendation
- Translated model output into stakeholder-friendly insights
- Created SMART business recommendations (e.g., flagging high credit utilization early)
- Considered fairness and ethical implications

---

### ✅ Task 4: AI-Powered Collections System Design
- Designed a high-level AI system to automate and personalize debt collection
- Defined inputs, logic, responsible AI guardrails, and business KPIs
- Highlighted the role of agentic AI vs. human-in-the-loop decisions
